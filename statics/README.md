# Intro to Statics
Engineering Statics is the gateway into **engineering mechanics** which is the application of newtonian physics to 
design and analyze objects, systems, and structure with respect to motion, deformation, and failue
The skills learned through statils whill allow you to develop skills in the art and practice of problem solcing 
and mathematical modeling, skills that will benefit us in the engineering of things and stuff.

The stupject is called "statics" because its converned with particles and rigid bodies that are in equilibrium,
and these will usually be stationary. i.e. static
